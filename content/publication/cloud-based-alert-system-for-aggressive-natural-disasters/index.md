abstract: "In 2010, region of Angra dos Reis, a municipality of Brazil, was
severely affected by landslides that killed nearly 50 people. Through a
technical cooperation agreement between Geovoxel and Civil Defense, the first
stage of a case study was recently completed in Angra dos Reis and has
demonstrated the potential of an early warning cloud-based system for
aggressive natural disaster. This system, called GVX and developed by the
company Geovoxel, is a cloud based web platform that integrates data captured
by instruments and geotechnical sensors in a georeferenced environment,
enabling rapid and decentralized analysis of ground movements, issuing alerts
and presenting the results in maps and dynamic graphics. The Civil Defense is
drawing up recommendations to be implemented in a second stage of system
development with the objective of making an inventory of improvements in GVX
system for decision making. For the success of this second stage, strategic
partnerships were signed with TWIST and Aquamet. The technologies of the three
companies will allow a greater volume of data included in the current system
such as the integration of instruments and meteorological sensors such as
electronic rain gauges the CEMADEN (Brazilian Center for Monitoring and
Alerting of Natural Disasters) and also localized weather forecast."
