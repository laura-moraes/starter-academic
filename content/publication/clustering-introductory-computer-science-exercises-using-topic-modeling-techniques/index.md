abstract: "Manually  determining  which  concepts  are  present in  a  group  of
questions  is  a  time  consuming  and  challenging process.  However,  this  is
an  important  step  when  building  a virtual learning environment, since
mastery level assessment and recommendation  engines  require  a  mapping
between  concepts and questions. We investigated the use of unsupervised
semantic models,  known  as  topic  modeling  techniques,  to  assist  computer
science  teachers  in  this  task.  We  propose  a  modelling approach   to
transform   CS1   teacher-provided   code   solutions into  representative  text
documents,  including  the  codeâ€™s  own structure   information   in   the
generated   features.   Using   non-negative  factorization  and  latent
dirichlet  allocation,  we  extract the  underlying  relationship  between
questions  and  validate  the results using an external dataset. Furthermore, we
considered the interpretability  of  the  learned  concepts  using  data
provided  by 14 university professors. The results showed that, in the
current dataset,  we  were  able  to  find  six  semantically  coherent
clusters.When tested with an unseen dataset, the six topics were able
to comprise  the  main  concepts  present  in  the  test  set,  achieving 0.75
in  the  normalized  pointwise  mutual  information  metric.This  metric  has
shown  to  be  correlated  with  human  ratings.The  proposed  method  could
be  useful  to  provide  semantics  for large  amounts  of  un-annotated  code."
