abstract: "The ability to understand a personâ€™s knowledge is important in
educational settings. This can be used to recognize gaps in knowledge and to
diagnose misunderstandings and misconceptions. This paper presents an
intelligent tutoring system created to gather student knowledge data and the
proposed methodology to generate the datasets. We asked 14 professors to
determine the concepts found in a set of problems and we compare the student
behavior found in each methodology."
