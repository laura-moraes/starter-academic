abstract: "ATLAS Experiment is an international collaboration where more than
37 countries, 172 institutes and laboratories, 2900 physicists, engineers, and
computer scientists plus 700 students participate. The management of this
teamwork involves several aspects such as institute contribution, employment
records, members' appointment, authors' list, preparation and publication of
papers and speakers nomination. Previously, most of the information was
accessible by a limited group and developers had to face problems such as
different terminology, diverse data modeling, heterogeneous databases and
unlike users needs. Moreover, the systems were not designed to handle new
requirements. The maintenance has to be an easy task due to the long lifetime
experiment and professionals turnover. The Glance system, a generic mechanism
for accessing any database, acts as an intermediate layer isolating the user
from the particularities of each database. It retrieves, inserts and updates
the database independently of its technology and modeling. Relying on Glance, a
group of systems were built to support the ATLAS management and operation
aspects: ATLAS Membership, ATLAS Appointments, ATLAS Speakers, ATLAS Analysis
Follow-Up, ATLAS Conference Notes, ATLAS Thesis, ATLAS Traceability and DSS
Alarms Viewer. This paper presents the overview of the Glance information
framework and describes the privilege mechanism developed to grant different
level of access for each member and system."
