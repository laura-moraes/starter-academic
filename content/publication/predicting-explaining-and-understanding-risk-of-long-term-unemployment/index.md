abstract: "Predictive models are used by public employment services to forecast
registrants’risk of becoming long-term unemployed, and to develop proactive,
preventative interventions to help them develop their skills and find work.
Traditionally, simple statistical models are used due to their interpretability.
However, we found that even simple models may not be understandable by the case
workers who use them,defeating the performance/complexity trade-off to the
detriment of individual sat risk.  Recent advances in model explainability yield
the possibility of using more accurate predictive models while at the same time
providing understandable and actionable explanations. We compare the predictive
precision of simple and complex models, and use SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) values to provide informative risk scores and actionable recourse
to assist case workers in helping at-risk individuals to understand which
factors contribute to their risk."
