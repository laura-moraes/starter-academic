abstract: "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), Learning Management System
(LMS), Intelligent Tutoring Systems(ITS) and Personalized Learning Systems
(PLS) are learning environments that have become more widely adopted in recent
years. These systems collect an increasing amount of data that can be mined to
support data-driven decision making. However, for it to be useful, this amount
of data have to be presented in a way for stakeholders to act on it. This paper
presents a learning environment, based on a teaching methodology,to collect
student data using complementary approaches. We then mine the collected dataset
providing demonstrations on how the discovered patterns can be acted upon by
professors and educators to identify students at risk of dropping out and
curricula improvements. We propose a drop-out prediction model that achieves a
0.81 F1 score and corroborates several literature findings of the most
important prediction features.We also surveyed the studentsâ€™ about the impact
of the system on their study practices, receiving a positive overall response."
